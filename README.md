# Compression-with-Constraints-Steganography
The natural images are compressible, usually a full size image of several megabytes can be reduced to kilobytes level easily without lossing too much important information. Such property has been used widely to denoising, deblur, etc. techniques.

The steganography is a topic lying in the cryptography. It is concealing a file, message, image, or video within another file, message, image, or video.

The advantage of steganography over cryptography alone is that the intended secret message does not attract attention to itself as an object of scrutiny. Plainly visible encrypted messages, no matter how unbreakable they are, arouse interest and may in themselves be incriminating in countries in which encryption is illegal.

Whereas cryptography is the practice of protecting the contents of a message alone, steganography is concerned both with concealing the fact that a secret message is being sent and its contents.

Steganography includes the concealment of information within computer files. In digital steganography, electronic communications may include steganographic coding inside of a transport layer, such as a document file, image file, program or protocol. Media files are ideal for steganographic transmission because of their large size. For example, a sender might start with an innocuous image file and adjust the color of every hundredth pixel to correspond to a letter in the alphabet. The change is so subtle that someone who is not specifically looking for it is unlikely to notice the change.

In this project, we deal with a special case: stegranography with images only. So unlike many practical scenes, for instance, encrypt text, document in images, this task might not be able to produce perfect recovery of information.
